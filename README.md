# React Data Grid 

Installation
------------

```sh
npm install react-data-grid
```

This library is written with CommonJS modules. If you are using
browserify, webpack, or similar, you can consume it like anything else
installed from npm.

Overview 
--------
ReactDataGrid is an advanced JavaScript spreadsheet-like grid component built using React

Themes
------
We use [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). If you want your Grid to get the "default" styling like the picture above, you'll need to include it separately.

```
npm install bootstrap
```
and then import the css from the dist folder when bootstrapping your application
```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```
